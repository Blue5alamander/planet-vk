A set of C++ wrappers that can be used with the Vulkan APIs and provide some convenience, like RAII.


## Requirements

Packages needed on Debian systems:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libvulkan-dev vulkan-validationlayers-dev
```

You'll also need [a copy of `glscl`](https://github.com/google/shaderc), which is not currently packaged.
